**Step count** in your code refers to the number of detected steps or foot movements taken by the player **without dribbling the basketball**.

### More detailed explanation:

* It tracks the player's foot movement by monitoring changes in the **vertical position of the ankles** across video frames.
* When the ankle's vertical position changes beyond a certain threshold (indicating a step or a foot lifting/moving), the code increments the step count.
* This count is used to detect potential **travel violations** in basketball â€” where a player takes too many steps without dribbling the ball.

---

### So, practically:

* **Step count = how many steps the player has taken without dribbling.**
* When the player dribbles, the step count resets to 0 because dribbling "resets" their foot movement count.
* If the player takes **too many steps without dribbling**, the program flags it as a **travel violation**.

### Why is this important?

In basketball, traveling is a rule violation where a player moves their feet illegally without dribbling the ball. Counting steps helps identify this.

Let me know if you want me to explain how the code uses the step count for travel detection!
